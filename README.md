## Description

This Harry Potter rating app was built with React and uses the Harry Potter [Legacy API](http://www.theboywholivedapi.fun/) for information on the characters.

## Built With

React, CSS, Bootstrap

## Challenges and Future Implementations

- 'Save to My Characters' button is meant to add that specific character to the user's Saved Characters page
- Saved Characters meant to lead to a Character Details page as well as option to add to a Loved Characters page or a Hated Characters page
- Ratings are not saved when navigating away from the page and coming back to that page
